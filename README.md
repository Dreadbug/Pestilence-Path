# Pestilence-Path
## An Oregon Trail-Inspired Browser Game Set in Medieval Europe
Europe, 1347. You're a plague doctor travelling cross-continent with your family. Your task is to make two full crossings of the continent, bringing the light to a place filled with corruption and darkness. Are you up to the challenge?

Taking inspiration from the classic Oreegon Trail games, this project would have you step into the shoes of a 17th-century plague doctor. Not only must you deal with the brutality of long-distance travel with your entire family, but you must also deal with the harsh realities of caravan life. But it doesn't stop there. Once you make it to the city, you must survive treating your patients. When all is said and done, another city awaits. And so the cycle continues.

### Planned Features
**Seasons: ** The time of year will have wider implications for the player's party. The most notable being weather events and food availability.

**Adaptive Pace: **The weather and player's health will determine how far the player can go in a given day.

**Dynamic Difficulty: **The difficulty will fluctuate as the player moves thorugh the seasons. Random events will also becoem more harsh as supplies dwindle and health runs out.

**Better Hunting Controls: **I have always found the hunting controls in Oregon Trail to be rather cumbersome, and plan to implement traditional WASD controls.

**Old-English Mode: **Places the entire game in Shakespearean-style English.

**The Plague: **Takes the place of dysentery. The player is a plague doctor that mut cure patients across Europe. However, the player and their party are exposed to it.

# The Technical Side
## The Project is not Complete
As the heading says, this project is not yet completed. Most of the actual game logic has not being completed yet. As such I would recommend not downloading anything just yet as it will most likely be changed in the future.

Once this project is complete it will most likely be posted on GitHub Pages to be played. Another possibility is itch.io. Both will be linked here once the project is complete.

## Why was this Project Created?
This project was created mostly to learn how to use HTML and JavaScript. I participated in a hackathon where both were used, but it was stressful trying to learn it and implement it within 24 hours. Most of my programming knowledge at the time was Python.

The exact premise of the game came from many hours of playing Oregon Trail and learning about the Black Death during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most inspiration came from the famous 'You have died of dysentery' line. It is not intended to be totally faithful to history.
