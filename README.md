##An Oregon Trail-Inspired Browser Game Set in Medieval Europe
Europe, 1347. You're a plague doctor travelling across Europe with your family. Your task is to make two full crossings of the continent, bringing the light to a place filled with corruption and darkness. Are you up to the challenge?

Taking inspiration from the classic Oreegon Trail games, this project would have you step into the shoes of a 17th-century plague doctor. Not only must you deal with the brutality of long-distance travel with your entire family, but you must also deal with the harsh realities of caravan life. But it doesn't stop there. Once you make it to the city, you must survive treating your patients. When all is said and done, another city awaits. And so the cycle continues.
